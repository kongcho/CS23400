# Lab2: Adversarial Localization
## Team 2: Lucy Newman, Natalia Kisanga, Cho Yin Kong 

## Summary
In this lab, we collected RSS data traces from 3 locations as robotic cars moved along marked trajectories near a hidden WiFi camera. Our goal is to use the location of the car and the RSS data form the refeiver to find an algorithm that predicts the location of the WiFi transmitter.

## Method

First, we parsed the data and stored each data trace into a log class. Then, we further classified each trace into a mac class, based on the 4 different mac addresses given to us. For each log, we made measurements 

## Algorithm

We used 

## Results

For the two locations we know, our model predicts these locations:

8c:85:90:16:0a:a4  = (x,y) Error = 
ac:9e:17:7d:31:e8  = (x,y) Error = 

These are our predictions for the two unknown Mac Address locations:

d8:c4:6a:50:e3:b1 = (x,y)
f8:cf:c5:97:e0:9e = (x,y)
